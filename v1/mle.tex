\section{Maximum-Likelihood Estimation}

One of the central aspects of Ilya's talk is that he talks about the relationship between ``prediction'' and ``compression'' as a reason why a technique called ``distribution matching'' might explain the success of the ``large language model''.

Just in general, we might observe that there are deep connections between the following concepts.

\subsection{Maximum Likelihood Estimation}
\subsection{Maximizing the Likelihood of the Data}
\subsection{Compressing the Data Set}
\subsection{Predictions on Unseen Data}
